## ⚙️ How It Works

- Location data is stored in `services.geojson`
- `script.js` renders markers, filters, popups, and search functionality
- The animated landing screen auto-hides after 5 seconds (or manually via button)
- All map controls, search, and legend are hidden behind the landing until it clears
